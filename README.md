# Neovim Config

Set up a GH repo for my config so that I can share amongst different machines.
I also wanted to be able to keep branch of my Vimscript settings if I switch to using Lua.

### Old Config
This feature branch contains my old set up written in vimscript. I wanted to keep a hold this before I redo the config in lua.
